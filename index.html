                <span id="firstLetter">F</span>or as long as people have watched the apples and other fruit fall from
                the branches they have been on the look out for ways of getting the most from them.
                Whether it is eating them as they are, using them in the kitchen or feeding
                them to another animal, any of these are a good start.
            </p>

            <aside>
                On the suppliers page you can give or receive apples, items of equipment or
                a little assistance. Example expert tip: All cider is wine but not all wine is cider.

                Soon though, you find
                it hard to find an appetite for the abundance of suguary nourishment.
                But what if you could make it into a drink, that could be stored for many months?
                Maybe there would be greater demand for apple flavours in the other parts of the year,
                when everywhere isn't so inundated with this food stuff.

                The following pages aim to guide you through the simple processes which
                will enable you to make your own cider, and the know-how can also be
                applied to other fruits as well.
